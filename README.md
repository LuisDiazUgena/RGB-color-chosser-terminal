# RGB-color-chosser-terminal

This is a RGB Color chosser from the terminal. Not very nice coded, but it works.

### Usage

Sent R,G,B,r,g or b from the terminal and a number between 0 - 999. If the number is over 255 is going to fix the value to 255.

As I said, it's not very nice coded, but it works.
